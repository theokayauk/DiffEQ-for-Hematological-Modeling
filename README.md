# DiffEQ-for-Hematological-Modeling
*Code to model and simulate dynamic hematological systems using differential equations*

The processes by which the body keeps blood and the immune system in a state of homeostasis are complex. Dynamic, complex systems such as hematopoeisis are often best modeled
and analyzed using differential equations. Specifically, differential equations are useful in the construction of a phase diagram for a system, which is useful for describing its equilibrium states and inputs which diverge from those states. This is particularly important for understanding hematopoeisis. Since a hematologically normal state
is an important equilibrium for the system, many diseases of the blood can be thought of as divergences from the primary equilibrium state. Since phase diagram approaches 
using differential equations offer a way to model and understand these divergences, they are evidently useful in studying dynamic diseases of the blood.
This repository will be used to develop and host files in a package for creating and exploring such models.
